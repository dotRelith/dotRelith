## Introduction
I recently completed an internship at Receita Federal do Brasil, where I gained valuable experience in IT. Although I did not work directly with software development during my internship, I have a strong foundation in programming languages including C#, Python, and JavaScript, and have worked on personal projects using Node.JS and React. My main focus recently has been on developing my dotCapture application. I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and am always looking to learn more and improve my skills. I am currently seeking a full-time software development role and am excited for the future. Please feel free to connect with me on GitHub or reach out to chat about any opportunities.
